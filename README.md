I'm a software engineer with a tendency towards web and mobile development in general. I'm always eager to provide a smooth and pleasant user experience for the end-user of web and mobile applications. My weapon of choice is JavaScript, more specifically Angular and React framework. I'm interested in UX and UI in terms of how we can influence the user through design and interactions.
